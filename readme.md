## I use the kafka-server from docker container.If you wish to use like me i leave the all the docker configs. 
## I leave the .sh commands to check your kafka cluster, topics, producers, consumers etc. from your unix cli.
## I keep posting more features about apache-kafka. Don't worry!
## My kafka version is uses kafka/kraft not zookeeper.
